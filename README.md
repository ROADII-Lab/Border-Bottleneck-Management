# 1. Project Description

### ROADII Background

Research, Operational, and Artificial Intelligence Data Integration Initiative (ROADII) is a multi-year initiative led by the United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO).

ROADII’s vision is to expand U.S. transportation agencies’ (regional, state, local, tribal, etc.) access to advanced data analytics knowledge and resources including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The ROADII team:
- Identifies and evaluates **use cases** that can benefit from advanced data analytics, AI, and ML
- Develops **proofs-of-concept** for use cases
- **Engages stakeholders** with proofs-of-concept and refine based on stakeholder feedback
- **Makes advanced data analytics, AI, and ML tools** available to the public at a central location (e.g., ITS CodeHub) 

The processes and tools developed under ROADII will enable data scientists, researchers, and data providers to test and share new transportation-related AI algorithms; to develop high-value and well-documented AI training datasets; to reduce the barriers of applying AI approaches to transportation data; and to train future transportation researchers.

### ROADII Use Case - Border Wait Times

- **Full Title:** “Estimating Border Wait Times Using Real-Time Video Feeds” 
- **Purpose and goals of the project:** El Paso's six Ports of Entry (POEs) can experience major congestion, which impacts freight and personal vehicle travel. Wait times are provided on public websites but determined anecdotally. This prototpe will evaluate computer vision and LLMs that leverage video feeds. The main goal is to generate real-time traveler information on the border crossings to keep stakeholders informed about changing conditions. A secondary goal is to inform long-term management strategies at each of the border crossings, such as staffing and pricing for vehicles.


- **Purpose of the source code and how it relates to the overall goals of the project:** This code will employ two methods to pull video feeds from existing links then generate wait time estimates using computer vision and LLM methodologies. 


- **Length of the project:** The code base is currently in a stable state. The ROADII Team may push updates irregularly as new data become available that might be used to update the model

# 2. Prerequisites

Requires:
- Installation of Python 3.6.0 or later
- Installation of Python packages listed in *requirements.txt*

# 3. Usage

This will be updated as the prototype is developed. 

# 4. Additional Notes



**Known Issues:** None identified, this use case is still in development and future updates will be tested sufficiently before being released. 



# 5. Version History and Retention

**Status:** This project is in active development phase. 

**Release Frequency:** This project will be updated when there are stable developments.  

**Retention:** This project will likely remain publicly accessible indefinitely.
